    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Making bakery-worthy chocolate chip cookies is much easier than it seems. You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:</p>
    <h2>Cookies Ingredients</h2>
    <p>The Allrecipes community adores this lasagna recipe because it's incredibly customizable, so you can easily alter the ingredient list to suit your needs. If you want to stay true to the original recipe, though, these are the ingredients you'll need to add to your grocery list:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Butter:</strong> This classic chocolate chip cookie recipe starts with two sticks of butter creamed with white and brown sugars. The blend of sugars creates a perfectly balanced flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> Eggs add moisture and act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the dough together.</li>
        <li><strong>Vanilla:</strong> Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the chocolate chip cookies.</li>
        <li><strong>Baking Soda:</strong> Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise.</li>
        <li><strong>Water:</strong> A bit of hot water creates steam as it bakes, working with the baking soda to puff the cookies up.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt:</strong> A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won't make the cookies taste salty.</li>
        <li><strong>Flour:</strong> All-purpose flour helps create gluten, which adds structure to the cookie dough.</li>
        <li><strong>Egg:</strong> An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</li>
        <li><strong>Chocolate Chips: </strong> Of course, you'll need semisweet chocolate chips! You can use dark or milk chocolate chips if you prefer.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Beat the butter and sugars, then beat in the eggs and vanilla.</li>
        <li>Dissolve the baking soda in hot water and add to the mixture.</li>
        <li>Stir in the flour, chocolate chips, and walnuts.</li>
        <li>Drop dough onto a prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake until the edges are golden brown.</li>
    </ol>
